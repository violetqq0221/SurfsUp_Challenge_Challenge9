 To provide a further in-depth analysis, I would like to analyze the temperature for each station. This further analysis can narrow down the optimal locations for new stores.
 * We can also analyze the precipitation difference between June and December to determine the water vapor condition of the weather, since the weather condition will also affect the business. The precipitation factor will also provide a valuable reference for making decision.
